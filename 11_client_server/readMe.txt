The first time I came to this market, Mr. Das showed me
 around personally. Taking an age to reach the place,
 I spent most of the journey naively fearing for his
  life as he wobbled over the uneven ground, narrowly
   missing jostling vehicles in the ceaseless stream of
    passing traffic. Das strode into this playground with
    the air of a statesman surveying his empire.
    With ceremony, he proudly introduced me to his most trusted traders.

We weaved between rows of seemingly identical stores,
each one a little wooden-framed theatre, roofed with tarpaulin,
 overflowing with vibrant displays of produce in neat rows
  and stacks. Periodically, Das would pause, furrow his brow
   and furtively disclose his closely-guarded trade secrets,
   ‘this is the best brinjal’, ‘never buy milk here’,
    ‘come early for shrimp.’

After that first tour I was on my own. As the weeks went by,
 I ended up finding my own favourite stalls,
 deviating from Das’ officially sanctioned list.
 Ultimately,
  I ended up befriending one stall owner in particular —
   Babu Das — who I returned to week after week with
  exclusive loyalty.

My visits to his stall were akin to those nostalgic films
 where a young boy is sent to the newsagent by his parents. After identifying all the items that I wished to purchase in a mix of mangled Bengali and pointing, Babu would put my vegetables to one side as if he’d had enough of the dirty work of business. Almost without fail, he would then pick up a large pea pod and prize apart the flesh, dropping a handful of crisp little peas into my hand to munch down like sweets.


As our familiarity deepened, in a moment of extravagance,
 he would occasionally slice a cucumber and toss the segments
  into a bag with some salt, chilli, coriander,
  and doused in lemon juice. Once, as a special treat,
   he made me a surprise bag with green mango he freshly
    chopped up, adding in chilli, coriander and mustard sauce.
    tastebuds nearly exploded with the eye-watering tang of
    the green mango and the rocketing heat of the little
    Bird’s Eye chillies.

                                   missing jostling vehicles in the ceaseless stream of
                                    passing traffic. Das strode into this playground with
                                    the air of a statesman surveying his empire.
                                    With ceremony, he proudly introduced me to his most trusted traders.

                                We weaved between rows of seemingly identical stores,
                                each one a little wooden-framed theatre, roofed with tarpaulin,
                                 overflowing with vibrant displays of produce in neat rows
                                  and stacks. Periodically, Das would pause, furrow his brow
                                   and furtively disclose his closely-guarded trade secrets,
                                   ‘this is the best brinjal’, ‘never buy milk here’,
                                    ‘come early for shrimp.’

                                After that first tour I was on my own. As the weeks went by,
                                 I ended up finding my own favourite stalls,
                                 deviating from Das’ officially sanctioned list.
                                 Ultimately,
                                  I ended up befriending one stall owner in particular —
                                   Babu Das — who I returned to week after week with
                                  exclusive loyalty.

                                My visits to his stall were akin to those nostalgic films
                                 where a young boy is sent to the newsagent by his parents. After identifying all the items that I wished to purchase in a mix of mangled Bengali and pointing, Babu would put my vegetables to one side as if he’d had enough of the dirty work of business. Almost without fail, he would then pick up a large pea pod and prize apart the flesh, dropping a handful of crisp little peas into my hand to munch down like sweets.


                                As our familiarity deepened, in a moment of extravagance,
                                 he would occasionally slice a cucumber and toss the segments
                                  into a bag with some salt, chilli, coriander,
                                  and doused in lemon juice. Once, as a special treat,
                                   he made me a surprise bag with green mango he freshly
                                    chopped up, adding in chilli, coriander and mustard sauce.
                                    tastebuds nearly exploded with the eye-watering tang of
                                    the green mango and the rocketing heat of the little
                                    Bird’s Eye chillies.
                                    The first time I came to this market, Mr. Das showed me
                                     around personally. Taking an age to reach the place,
                                     I spent most of the journey naively fearing for his
                                      life as he wobbled over the uneven ground, narrowly

                                                 Ultimately,
                                                  I ended up befriending one stall owner in particular —
                                                   Babu Das — who I returned to week after week with
                                                  exclusive loyalty.

                                                My visits to his stall were akin to those nostalgic films
                                                 where a young boy is sent to the newsagent by his parents. After identifying all the items that I wished to purchase in a mix of mangled Bengali and pointing, Babu would put my vegetables to one side as if he’d had enough of the dirty work of business. Almost without fail, he would then pick up a large pea pod and prize apart the flesh, dropping a handful of crisp little peas into my hand to munch down like sweets.


                                                As our familiarity deepened, in a moment of extravagance,
                                                 he would occasionally slice a cucumber and toss the segments
                                                  into a bag with some salt, chilli, coriander,
                                                  and doused in lemon juice. Once, as a special treat,
                                                   he made me a surprise bag with green mango he freshly
                                                    chopped up, adding in chilli, coriander and mustard sauce.
                                                    tastebuds nearly exploded with the eye-watering tang of
                                                    the green mango and the rocketing heat of the little
                                                    Bird’s Eye chillies.
                                                    The first time I came to this market, Mr. Das showed me
                                                     around personally. Taking an age to reach the place,
                                                     I spent most of the journey naively fearing for his
                                                      life as he wobbled over the uneven ground, narrowly
                                                       missing jostling vehicles in the ceaseless stream of
                                                        passing traffic. Das strode into this playground with
                                                        the air of a statesman surveying his empire.
                                                        With ceremony, he proudly introduced me to his most trusted traders.

                                                    We weaved between rows of seemingly identical stores,
                                                    each one a little wooden-framed theatre, roofed with tarpaulin,
                                                     overflowing with vibrant displays of produce in neat rows
                                                      and stacks. Periodically, Das would pause, furrow his brow
                                                       and furtively disclose his closely-guarded trade secrets,
                                                       ‘this is the best brinjal’, ‘never buy milk here’,
                                                        ‘come early for shrimp.’

                                                    After that first tour I was on my own. As the weeks went by,

After identifying all the items that I wished to purchase in a mix of mangled Bengali and pointing, Babu would put my vegetables to one side as if he’d had enough of the dirty work of business. Almost without fail, he would then pick up a large pea pod and prize apart the flesh, dropping a handful of crisp little peas into my hand to munch down like sweets.
